## Description

  This project aims to develop a modern text editor that runs entirely within the browser. The application is designed as a single-page application (SPA) and adheres to the Progressive Web App (PWA) criteria, ensuring it can be seamlessly used both online and offline. It incorporates multiple data persistence techniques to provide redundancy, ensuring that user data is reliably stored even when certain browser features are unavailable.
